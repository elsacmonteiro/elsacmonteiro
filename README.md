### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

My name is **Elsa Monteiro**, I'm 31 years old, and I'm from **Porto, Portugal** 🇵🇹. I started programming recently, and since 2021, I have been working in technology companies, specifically in the software field, which sparked my interest in this area.

🎓 I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Marketing**, which has given me strong skills in understanding user behavior, visual communication, and branding—essential when creating intuitive and engaging front-end interfaces.  

📘 I also have a **Postgraduate degree in Sales Management**, which sharpened my skills in problem-solving, communication, and delivering client-focused solutions—qualities that align perfectly with the user-centered approach in front-end development.

💡 What drew me to programming was the incredible power it gives us to build solutions from scratch. I love combining **creativity with logic**, and I’m always excited to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

🌱 I'm passionate about **technology** and **software development**, always seeking to grow and contribute to impactful projects.

🌍 Outside of work, I love **traveling**, **Italian food**, and spending time in **nature** to recharge and stay inspired.
